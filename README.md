About Me:

Hi my name is Reggie Alleyne, I'm a UX/UI Designer based in Los Angeles. I am always looking for a new challenge and always continue to hustle. I started my career as freelance graphic designer, working with local musicians and club promoters. I really had a love for this type of work so I began doing logos for a sportswear company. Years later I discovered UX/UI Design and completed an immersive course, gaining my UX/UI certification. I am now currently learning Javascript and a few more web development languages to add to my skillset. No matter what, keep learning and growing.
